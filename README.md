**Overview:**
Petri Simulator is a 2D simulation game where players control a bacteria navigating a petri dish environment. The objective is to survive and eliminate enemy bacteria while consuming food to multiply.

**Game Environment:**
- The game is set within a petri dish, represented by a pink background.
- Bacteria and food particles are represented by colored pixels.

**Player-Controlled Bacteria (Blue):**
- Players start with a single blue bacteria they can control using the keyboard.
- Movement is controlled with the WASD keys.

**Enemy Bacteria (Red):**
- Red bacteria move autonomously within the environment.
- They seek out the nearest food particle or player-controlled bacteria within a certain range.

**Food Particles (White):**
- Food particles spawn randomly within the environment.
- Consuming food allows bacteria to multiply.

**Game Mechanics:**
- When a bacteria consumes food, it multiplies, creating additional bacteria of the same color.
- Collisions between different colored bacteria result in their elimination.
- The game ends when either all red bacteria are eliminated (win) or the player-controlled bacteria is eliminated and no green bacteria are left to control (lose).

**Controls:**
- W: Move up
- A: Move left
- S: Move down
- D: Move right
- Q: Quit the game

**Win/Lose Conditions:**
- Win: All red bacteria are eliminated.
- Lose: No controllable bacteria remain.

This simulation game provides a unique blend of strategy and action, challenging players to navigate the dangers of the petri dish while managing their own bacterial colony.
